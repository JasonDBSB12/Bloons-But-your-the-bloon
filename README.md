UPDATE (22nd Feb 2023, Version 1,2,1):

MAKE SURE YOU DOWNLOAD THE LATEST VERSION OF THE GAME BELOW TO PLAY WITH PLAYERS THAT ALSO HAVE THIS UPDATE. The game does not update automatically. 

Small update this time around, some features but mostly bug fixes and balancing:

1. Glue projectile no longer passes through walls 

2. Corrosive glue no longer does damage after you finish the round 

3. Fixed private matches not starting if players both try to join too quickly 

4. Added option to mute music in main menu 

5. Altered abilities to be more powerful early on but they now give less and less multiplier the more they are upgraded 

6. Upped super monkey cost (still subject to change)

7. Added time limit for bloon per round to avoid AFK players (resets if the bloon dies) 

8. Moab now moves at 0.65x the bloon speed instead of 0.5x, also slightly lowered cost but decreased effectiveness of speedboost on it to encourage the tanky but slow playstyle 

9. Spike nerfed to only do half the damage and hitbox has also been made slightly smaller (still subject to change)

10. Engineer monkey added 

11. ZOMG added once the moab health reaches >250 

12. Lowered range of tack shooter to actually match btd 6 

13. A few other small tweaks



UPDATE (28th Jan 2023, Version 1,2):

- Multiplayer! A new game mode in which one player plays as a monkey placing down towers, and the other player plays as the bloon and tries to get to round 20!

- Bloon Abilities! Super speed, fortification and regrow amp are new abilities that can be bought and used once per round. 

- The AI can place road spikes and glue on the track, these have also been added to the monkey's arsenal.

- New tower, the glue gunner

- Slowing towers such as arctic wind now slow you down to half of your current max speed, as opposed to half of the starting out speed. 

- Other small tweaks



UPDATE (25th Dec 2022, Version 1,1):

- Endless Mode is now out of beta, starting from round 40, tower damage will slowly increase. The sun temple no longer spawns in endless mode, but sun avatars have a random chance of spawning after round 30. 

- MOABS! Players can now upgrade the "MOAB Health" stat to become a moab. Moabs have larger hitboxes, move at half the speed of a normal bloon and are not affected by regrow, but they gain 25 health per upgrade!

- Difficulties (easy, medium, hard) each difficulty has a different boss monkey which spawns in the final round, you receive less cash the higher the difficulty, and tougher difficulties have more rounds (20 in easy, 25 in medium, 30 in hard). 

- 2 new maps, park path & cornfield. 

- New tower, the Monkey Ace. 

- Dart & Super Monkeys are now much more accurate.

- The plasma monkey damage per shot has been increased to 2 from 1.

- Flowers no longer act as obstacles to projectiles.

- You can no longer brush past projectiles and avoid damage.

- Normalised movement so pressing 2 movement keys at once no longer makes you move 50% faster, as a result of this the base speed has been buffed from 6 to 8, and upgrading speed now gives you 0.5 speed instead of 0.4. 

- Fixed regrow loading up a free health point (still happens sometimes, but much less often).

- Fixed music playing twice when you lose.

- Fixed bug where the boss tower doesn't spawn sometimes. 

- And MUCH more!
